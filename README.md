# LSTM Stock Price Prediction Pipeline

A research-grade, end-to-end pipeline for forecasting **next-day closing stock prices** using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis in Finance / Data Science.

The pipeline covers the full machine-learning workflow: raw data ingestion → technical indicator enrichment → feature combination search → walk-forward validation → final model retraining → PnL backtesting → SHAP-based explainability → thesis-ready visualizations.

---

## Research Question

> Do technical indicators add predictive value to an LSTM model for next-day stock price forecasting compared to a naive persistence baseline?

The pipeline systematically evaluates **all non-empty subsets** of seven technical indicator groups (RSI, MACD, SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, Momentum, Rolling Volatility) across multiple large-cap US stocks over the period 2020–2025.

---

## Features

- **Brute-force feature combination search** — evaluates every subset of indicator groups; no manual feature selection
- **Walk-forward expanding-window validation** — time-series-safe model selection with no look-ahead bias
- **Three model selection criteria** — best validation RMSE, best directional accuracy (DA), best PnL ratio
- **Final retraining stage** — selected models are retrained on TRAIN+VAL and evaluated exactly once on the held-out TEST set
- **PnL backtesting** — simulated buy/hold/sell trading with configurable initial cash and signal threshold
- **SHAP explainability** — feature-level importance for the final LSTM models using gradient-based SHAP
- **Naive Persistence & Buy-and-Hold baselines** — hard-to-beat reference models included automatically
- **Multiple target modes** — next-day price (`price`), log/simple return (`return`), or binary direction (`direction`)
- **Stationarity reporting** — ADF + KPSS tests on every feature column; optional stationary-only filtering
- **Structured artifact saving** — every run saves models, scalers, histories, PnL logs, plots, and JSON summaries to a versioned run folder

## LSTM Architecture

Defined in `model.py`:

```
Input shape: (window_size=10, n_features)
    └─► LSTM(100 units, activation='tanh', recurrent_activation='sigmoid')
    └─► Dropout(0.2)
    └─► Dense(1, activation='linear')

Optimizer : Adam (learning_rate = 0.0001)
Loss      : Mean Squared Error (MSE)
```

**Design rationale:**
- A single LSTM layer is used to keep the model parsimonious and avoid overfitting on the relatively short daily time series (~1,250 trading days).
- 100 hidden units are sufficient to capture the temporal patterns across a 10-day lookback window.
- Dropout (rate = 0.2) is applied after the LSTM layer for regularization.
- A low learning rate (0.0001) ensures stable convergence.

---

## Technical Indicators

All indicators are computed in `indicators.py` using the settings in `config.yaml`.

| Group | Computed Features | Default Window |
|---|---|---|
| **MACD** | `MACD`, `MACD_signal`, `MACD_hist` | fast=12, slow=26, signal=9 |
| **RSI** | `RSI` | 14 days |
| **SMA** | `SMA` | 20 days |
| **EMA** | `EMA` | 20 days |
| **BB** | `BB_upper`, `BB_middle`, `BB_lower` | 20 days, 2σ |
| **MOM** | `Momentum` (close − 10-day rolling mean) | 10 days |
| **VOL** | `RollingVolatility` (log-return std) | 20 days |

Base features always included: `Close`, `Open` (and optionally `High`, `Low`, `Volume` if stationary filter permits).

With 7 groups there are **127 non-empty subsets** evaluated per ticker, plus one base-features-only run.

## Pipeline Stages (Notebook)

The main notebook (`LSTM_BA.ipynb`) runs the following stages in order:

| Cell | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Setup | Imports, config loading, global constants, reproducibility seed |
| 5 | Stationarity | ADF + KPSS tests; `ACTIVE_FEATURE_SET` filter |
| 6 | Feature groups | `INDICATOR_GROUPS` dict, `BASE_FEATURES`, `groups_to_feature_cols()` |
| 7 | Walk-forward engine | `eval_split()`, `run_one_fold()`, `run_one_combo_walk_forward()` |
| 10–11 | Search | Brute-force loop over all indicator subsets |
| 12 | Baseline | Naive Persistence + Buy-and-Hold evaluation |
| 14 | Presentation | Thesis-ready charts, co-occurrence heatmap, top-combo tables |
| 15 | Final retraining | `retrain_selected_model()` — train on TRAIN+VAL, evaluate on TEST |
| 16 | Artifact saving | `save_official_artifacts()` — saves everything to `runs/` |
| 17 | SHAP | Gradient SHAP for the final LSTM models |
| 26 | Analysis | Full result breakdown: metrics table, signal comparison, confusion matrix, PnL chart |

---

## Data Split Strategy

The dataset is split **chronologically** — no random shuffling.

```
|─────── TRAIN (70%) ──────|── VAL (10%) ──|── TEST (20%) ──|
  used in walk-forward folds  model selection   never touched
                                                 until final eval
```

**Walk-forward validation** (expanding window):
- Minimum training size: 50% of data
- Validation window: 10% of data per fold
- Step size: 5% per fold
- Models are selected by averaged validation metrics across all folds

**Final retraining:**
- Selected models are retrained on TRAIN+VAL combined (80% of data)
- Evaluated exactly once on the TEST set (20%)

## Evaluated Tickers

Data covers **2020-01-01 to 2025-01-01** (daily, adjusted close prices).

Full experiments were run for:

| Ticker | Company |

## Key Results Summary

### Naive Persistence Baseline (Test Set)

| Metric | AAPL | AMZN | GOOGL |
|---|---|---|---|
| RMSE | 2.89 | 3.28 | 2.92 |
| MAE | 2.12 | 2.44 | 2.10 |
| MAPE | 1.03% | 1.31% | 1.28% |
| R² | 0.987 | 0.962 | 0.963 |
| Directional Accuracy | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** |

*The naive baseline always predicts zero change, so it can never correctly predict direction.*

### Best LSTM Model — BEST_VAL_RMSE (Test Set)

| Metric | AAPL | AMZN | GOOGL |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feature combo | MACD+SMA+EMA+BB+MOM | MACD+EMA+BB+VOL | MACD+SMA+EMA+BB+MOM |
| RMSE | 5.85 | 4.96 | 5.86 |
| MAE | 4.78 | 3.68 | 4.86 |
| MAPE | 2.26% | 1.99% | 2.93% |
| R² | 0.948 | 0.913 | 0.851 |
| Directional Accuracy | 40.1% | 51.4% | 41.7% |

### Interpretation

The LSTM models do **not** outperform naive persistence on price-level accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²). This is expected: stock prices are strongly autocorrelated, so predicting "tomorrow = today" is already a very strong baseline for absolute price error.

However, the LSTM achieves **40–51% directional accuracy** while the naive baseline scores 0% DA. This demonstrates that the model captures genuine directional signal, which is more relevant for trading applications than absolute price error. MACD appears in 6 out of 9 best-performing feature combinations across all three tickers, making it the most consistently useful indicator group.
